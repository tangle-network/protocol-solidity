For additional information, please refer to the [Webb protocol-solidity implementation docs](https://webb-tools.github.io/protocol-solidity/) üìù. Have feedback on how to improve protocol-ink? Or have a specific question to ask? Checkout the [Anchor Protocol Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions/categories/anchor-protocol) üí¨.

## Prerequisites

Your development environment will need to include nodejs, and Rust setups. If you need to generate fixtures you will also require Circom 2.0 and snarkjs installations. You can find installation instructions below. 

This repository makes use of node.js, yarn, Rust, and requires version 16. To install node.js binaries, installers, and source tarballs, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once node.js is installed you may proceed to install [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Great! Now your **Node** environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

You must also have Rust installed. This guide uses <https://rustup.rs> installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest nightly version, and add the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Great! Now your Rust environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

Lastly, you need to install [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for fetching large ZK files.

**Note:** You may need additional dependencies, checkout [substrate.io](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/) for more information.

### Generating Fixtures Prerequisites

> NOTE: This is only required for testing / dev purposes and not required to compile or interact with smart contracts. 

To generate fixtures you will need Circom 2.0 and snarkjs installed. To install from source, clone the circom repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
```

Enter the circom directory and use the cargo build to compile:
```
cargo build --release
```

The installation takes around 3 minutes to be completed. When the command successfully finishes, it generates the circom binary in the directory `target/release`. You can install this binary as follows:
```
cargo install --path circom
```
The previous command will install the circom binary in the directory `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

#### Installing snarkjs

snarkjs is a npm package that contains code to generate and validate ZK proofs from the artifacts produced by circom.

You can install snarkjs with the following command:
```
npm install -g snarkjs
```

<h2 id="compile"> Installation & Compile üíª </h2>

Install dependencies: 

```
yarn install 
```

Update submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Populate fixtures from the submodules:

```
yarn fetch:fixtures
```

To compile contracts:

```
yarn compile
```

The above command will build the Solidity system, performing the following build steps:

1. Compile the smart contracts and generate appropriate typescript bindings in a folder `typechain` at the root directory. 

2. Compile the hashers. These hashers are provided to the merkle tree upon deployment.


**Note:** If you need to generate fixtures you should run:

```
yarn build
```

The above command will `compile` the contracts but also compile the circom circuits, and generate ptau. The ptau is needed for setup of zero knowledge proofs. This ptau is for test and development purposes only!

<h2 id="test"> Testing üß™ </h2>

To run the test suite, update the submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Fetch the fixtures:
```
yarn fetch:fixtures
```

Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Compile the contracts:

```
yarn compile
```

Run test suite:

```
yarn test
```

It is also possible to output a gas report of the contracts by running:

```
yarn test:gas-reporter
```

To fix the formatting, please run:

```
yarn format
```

To run TypeScript checks:

```
yarn ts-check
```

### Interacting

This repository contains a variety of scripts to deploy and interact with the smart contracts in the `scripts` folder. To use these scripts, one will need to setup an `.env` file in the root directory:

```
# Setup an endpoint
ENDPOINT=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/fff68ca474dd4764a8d54dd14fa5519e

# Add private key
PRIVATE_KEY=XXX-XXX-XXX
```
